### Rental controller Fullstack and Embedded engineering sample
This project contains a fully built out dashboard that allows you to monitor and send commands to embedded MCUs placed in various locations, it will also contain a metrics dashboard for each house with stats overtime. 

My intention is to branch out from using simple MCUs like the ESP32 coded in arduino to a fully fledged STM32 in C or C++ for usecases requiring more throughput and/or custom logic

my hope is to expand the project to contain MCUs with sensors for the following operations

- trash pickup 
- hot tub chemical balance detection
- propane level detection

Additionally I would like to expand the project to include AI driven agents that will consume sensor data and contact the proper services to execute trash pickup, propane refill, hot tub chemical balancing etc
